# KOFTA
## KOllector For Tired Admins

---

# Description
This is an attempt to create an SNMP stats collector for various network devices.
I grew tired of Cacti, I hate Zabbix, and I think that Collectd could do its job
better. I also hate non-BULK SNMPWALKs.

Enter **KOFTA** â€” the piece of Rails code that was born with a single purpose: To
replace Collectd and to feed InfluxDB with data, with style.

## State
As of 2016-May-22, the app is somewhat functional. InfluxDB connection and data sending is working, Web UI now has something that looks like a menu, Devices and Datatypes views are mostly done, repeating parts are moved to layout and shared partials. Dynamic query schedule is implemented using `rufus-scheduler`. Also, now it doesn't trigger jobs when Rails console is started, jobs start only when Rails App server is up.

## TODO
* ~~Make Rufus behave and to run only one scheduling thread per app instance~~ Done in c34e097;
* **Make SNMP Querier tasks multithreaded (to make it faster for bigger tables and/or remote nodes)** -- doing it now;
* Add some more metrics to `seeds.rb`;
* Finish Web UI;
* Write some docs and provide an example visualizing setup (Grafana Dashboard JSON);
* Add JRuby support for some multithreaded GC'ed quality time.

## Magic used
* Ruby 2.2 is required (2.3.x is recommended, JRuby would be ideal, but isn't tested yet);
* Rails 4.2.6 or newer;
* [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) 4+ as ActiveJob queue manager, made by [Mike Perham](https://github.com/mperham);
* Redis (required for Sidekiq, 3.0.3 or newer is best);
* Sqlite (for internal DB);
* [Ruby-SNMP](https://github.com/hallidave/ruby-snmp) gem for stat collection, made by [Dave Halliday](https://github.com/hallidave);
* [InfluxDB::Client](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-ruby) for DB connections, made and maintained by [Todd Persen](https://github.com/toddboom) and [Dominik Menke](https://github.com/dmke);
* [Bulma CSS](http://bulma.io/) for Web UI, made by [Jeremy Thomas](https://github.com/jgthms).

# Installation
## Getting the code and preparing for first start:
* `git clone <repo_URL> <app_dir>`;
* `cd <app_dir>`;
* `bundle install`;
* To initialize database: `rake db:setup`;
   This will init the DB with basic stuff (like, basic set of metrics that can be used to query devices)
* Start Redis (use your OS/Distro's way of starting services for this);
* Start Sidekiq with `bundle exec sidekiq`;
* If you want to test/develop it: `rails server`;
* If you want to see how it'll look/behave in real-er world: `RAILS_ENV=production rails server`.
